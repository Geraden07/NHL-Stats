Dependance on the third party module Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing


This project was created because the NHL.com career stats for players does not shot the ratio of points per game. The scripts in question are written to download the HTML pages, scrape the stats from the offline pages, then print them to the screen and write them to a JSON file after having calculated the new stat and sorted. I then can upload that JSON file to my web server where I have also written a page that can paginate through the list using ajax calls and a PHP script that serves up one page at a time of the JSON list.

Functional as of September 2014
